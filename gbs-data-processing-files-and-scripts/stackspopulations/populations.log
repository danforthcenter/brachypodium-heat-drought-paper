Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Removed 158135 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 173087 loci.
Kept 14952 loci, composed of 1358171 sites; 21927 of those sites were filtered, 2977 variant sites remained.
    1353966 genomic sites, of which 4205 were covered by multiple loci (0.3%).
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 90.83bp (stderr 0.04).
